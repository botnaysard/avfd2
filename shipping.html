These fees range depending on your country.  A  Very Fairy Door is not responsible for these charges. We must mark actual package value on the orders we ship.  We cannot reduce the value of your packages, or mark them as “gifts”. Should you refuse a package for any reason, all shipping costs, duties, taxes, and any fees imposed by your country will be deducted from the refund owed to you once we receive the return. All duties and fees are imposed as soon as a package reaches customs, and A Very Fairy Door is not responsible for any of those charges.
