		So much happiness comes from A Very Fairy Door:
		<br>Like comfort, encouragement, laughter and more!
		<br>When your child's not looking the fairies may bring
		<br>a treasure, a note, or most anything!
		<br>For sometimes magic is just what you need,
		<br>to brighten a day or to plant a seed,
		<br>to help through tough times or reward a great deed!

		<h1>How it Works</h1>
		<p>Getting a Very Fairy Door is really special!</p>
		<p>Hereâ€™s a message from your very fairy friends to guide you on what you can do to make it easier for them to come and visit.</p>
		<p>A wall, shelf or garden will do.<br>Hang the door in a place that's special to you.</p>
		<p>Once your door is hung, we can stop by and have some fun!</p>
		<p>We love to visit children who use good manners and are kind, so be sure to keep these rules in mind</p>
		<p>Do you know what's even better?  Doing nice things for others, like giving a letter.  Here's a little hint for you we love to get letters and drawings, too!</p>
		<p>If we haven't visited in a while, be sure to keep your biggest smile.  When you're a fairy there's lots to do, but we will never forget about you.</p>
		<p>We also love pictures of all our fun, so share some online with everyone!</p>
		<p>If you're wondering why we visit at night, it's because that's when our world is light.</p>
