			About
		</h1>
		<p>
			Carlie's mom, Kimberly, gave a fairy door to her granddaughter for her third birthday.   At the time, the family was experiencing some difficulties.
		</p> 
		<p>
			Seeing how how much her daughter enjoyed visits (and little gifts) from the fairies through those tough times, and sensing the fairy door's bigger potential as a parenting tool, Carlie began work on a children’s book to accompany the door.  Seeing the book begin to take shape, Kim set about improving the design an materials of the door iteself.
		</p>
		<p> 
			The result of these efforts is product (hardcover book + resin door) that can be can under many circumstances.
		</p>  
		<p>
			Of course kids love it when the fairies leave surprises "just because".  But the fairies can also leave gifts to reward and encourage good behaviour, or to mark milestones.  The fairy door can also help with the difficult things thir lives, such as fear of the dark, illness, or other forms of loss an hardship.  The fairies are always on hand to provide a smile.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is very important to Carlie and Kim to give back to others who are also going through difficult times. Having worked at children’s hospitals for the past 12 years, Carlie knows that nobody needs boost more than her patients and their families. As a direct result of their successful Kickstarter campaign 55+ books will be donated to The Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO) in hopes that it will bring joy and smiles to children in diffucult situations.
		</p> 
		<p>
			Kim and Carlie intend to donate as many books as possile to children’s hospitals on an ongoing basis, in order to put smiles on as many children’s faces as they can.
